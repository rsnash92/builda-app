- ✅ Member management with ownership tracking
- **Target**: 10 active clubs with daily messages

### **Week 3 Milestone: Economic Engine Complete**

- ✅ $1,500+ monthly recurring revenue from platform fees
- **Target**: 500+ registered users, sustainable growth

## 💰 **Revenue Model: Fee-Based Growth**

### **Platform Fee Structure**
- **Contribution Fee**: 3% on all USDC contributions to club treasuries
- **Club Creation**: **FREE** (no friction for new clubs)
- **Chat & Governance**: **FREE** (core platform features)
- **Revenue Split**: User contributes $100 → $3 to builda.club, $97 to club treasury

### **Revenue Projections**

#### **Month 3 Targets:**
- **100 active clubs** with avg $500 monthly contributions = $50k volume
- **Platform fees**: $50k × 3% = **$1,500 MRR**
- **New club creation**: 50 clubs/month (free, driving growth)

#### **Month 6 Targets:**
- **300 active clubs** with avg $750 monthly contributions = $225k volume
- **Platform fees**: $225k × 3% = **$6,750 MRR**
- **Total treasury value**: $1.5M+ across platform

#### **Year 1 Targets:**
- **1,000 active clubs** with sustained contribution activity
- **$500k+ monthly volume** = **$15k+ MRR** from platform fees
- **$10M+ total value locked** across all club treasuries

### **Why This Model Works:**
- **Aligned incentives**: We only make money when clubs are successful
- **No creation friction**: Anyone can start a club for free
- **Transparent & fair**: 3% is reasonable for treasury security + governance tools
- **Scalable**: Revenue grows directly with platform adoption

- **Future-proof architecture** (easy to add DeFi, governance, etc.)

### **Technical Benefits**
- **Simpler than traditional payments** (no webhook complexity)
- **Automatic compliance** (smart contracts enforce rules)
- **Global accessibility** (crypto removes geographic barriers)
- **Composable** (other protocols can integrate)

### **Market Timing**
- **Solana ecosystem growth** (cheap transactions, growing adoption)
- **Web3 social momentum** (Friend.tech, Farcaster success)
- **Creator economy evolution** (ownership over attention)
- **Community governance trends** (DAOs mainstream acceptance)
